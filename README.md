# D7024E Group 3
Repository for the distributed system in the course D7024E at Lule√• University of Technology.

# Prerequisites
If you want to run the project locally it's required to download the latest versions of [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) (we used go1.21.0). We recommend using VSCode for code editing, but any editor will work. In VSCode we can download extensions for Go, Docker and also Dev Containers which lets us use Docker containers as full-featured development environments.

# Build and run locally
Build the Docker image by running this in a terminal in the D7024E-Group-3 project directory:
```
docker build . -t kadlab
```
Start the network of containers:
```
docker compose up -d   
```
Enter the shell environment of any node by running:
```
docker exec -it <node-name> sh
```
To enter the Go program directly, we instead run:
```
docker attach <node-name>
```
To see the logs of a node:
```
docker logs <node-name>
```

An example of a node name is d7024e-group-3-kademliaNodes-1.

# Deploy to DUST VM
Any pushes to `main`, either directly or via pull requests, will result in an automatic deployment to the DUST VM. The deployment is performed by a GitHub Action (see `.github/workflows/main.yml`), which builds the Docker image and deploys the Docker containers accoring to the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The code can also be copied to the server manually via SSH:
```
scp -r -P 27001 PATH_TO_DIRECTORY\D7024E-Group-3\ martinaskolin@130.240.207.20:/home/martinaskolin/
```
The server is then reached via:
```
ssh -p 27001 martinaskolin@130.240.207.20
```
All Docker commands that are available locally, can also be executed on the server. Before starting new containers, the old ones should be removed. Same goes for the image.

Commands flags such as `ls` and `rm` are useful for listing and removing entities, such as listing all existing containers:
```
sudo docker container ls
```

# Debugging Docker Containers
## Check containers for certain log
By combining three commands using bash's pipes you can fetch (A.K.A. `grep`) all instances of a logged message:
```
docker ps --format "{{.Names}}" | xargs -I {} docker logs {} | grep ERROR
```

# Generate HTML Coverage Report

## Run test with coverage
First, enter the `src` directory:
```
cd PATH_TO_DIRECTORY\D7024E-Group-3\src
```
To run your tests with coverage analysis, use the `go test` command and write it to `coverage.out`:
```
go test -coverprofile=coverage ./...
```
The `./...` argument tells Go to recursively run tests in all packages within the current directory and its subdirectories.

In order to get the total coverage write the following command:
```
go tool cover -func=coverage
```

## Create HTML coverage report
In order to create a HTML coverage report to visualize the coverage in more detail write the following command:
```
go tool cover -html=coverage -o coverage.html
```

# Using the RESTful API
Locally, using Windows PowerShell, we can use the following commands to interact with the API:
```powershell
# POST to a node
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://localhost:PORT/objects" -Body '{"data": "DATA"}' -ContentType "application/json"

# GET from a node
$hash = HASH
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "http://localhost:PORT/objects/$hash"
```

Replacing `PORT` with the port of the node we want to interact with, `DATA` with the data to store, and `HASH` with the hash of the object we want to retrieve.

Remotely, we use the curl command:
```bash
# POST to a node
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": "DATA"}' http://ADDRESS:PORT/objects

# GET from a node
curl http://ADDRESS:PORT/objects/HASH
```
